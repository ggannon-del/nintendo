# Hack Day 1 - Getting a small product over the line

Today is all about teamwork. You will need to get a working (minimal) product over the line by a deadline.

## Starter code

There are two projects in this codebase, `frontend` (React/bootstrap) and `backend` (serverless AWS lambda). Please make sure you are in the correct folder/directory when trying to run various NPM commands etc.

## Getting Started

Each project has its own readme with specific instructions. Read them both. Do what they say.

Goal:

- Get frontend and backend running locally
- Get the communicating with each other
- Observe what you have been given as a starting point

## Where do we start?

Take a deep breath. The start of a project is the most exciting/confusing stage. This never changes.

It is possible to waste gargantuan amoounts of time doing nothing but busywork at the start of a project. Make sure you don't!

You have learned about presenting, teamwork and agile workflows. Your pre-learning has covered the basics of the technology (html, css, javascript, internet basics, command line).

Your work today is to figure out how to get a product over the line. You will leverage the starter code, the web, your prior learning, the tutors and each other to figure out how to do that.
